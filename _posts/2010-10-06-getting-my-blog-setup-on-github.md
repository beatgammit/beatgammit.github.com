  I just finished setting up this blog on github, and it's ironically the first repository that I have every created using git.  The entire process wasn't too painful.  I started by trying to just clone AJ's template, but that didn't work very well because I didn't know where to change the name of the repository.  I ended up creating a new repository named beatgammit.github.com and I copied over all of AJ's template code, so hopefully it works.

  Well, we'll see what happens with this.
